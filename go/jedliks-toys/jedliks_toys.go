// Your first steps could be to read through the tasks, and create
// these functions with their correct parameter lists and return types.
// The function body only needs to contain `panic("")`.
//
// This will make the tests compile, but they will fail.
// You can then implement the function logic one by one and see
// an increasing number of tests passing as you implement more
// functionality.
